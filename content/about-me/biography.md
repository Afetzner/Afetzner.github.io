## Early life
I grew up in a town outside of Chicago, IL. 
In high-school, I was in cross-country, and track-and-field as a runner. 
I was a mathlete, going to the Illinois state math competition one year.
I also played the French horn. 

I knew early that I was good at and enjoyed mathematics and science. 
Some of my favorite classes were my biology, chemistry, physics, and calculus classes because of the content. 
I also greatly enjoyed my European and American history classes as the teachers were excellently engaging.

<!--
One of my highlights of high school was an experiment some classmates and I designed in my AP biology class:
We grew pea plants under different colored lights and use a spectrometer to measure if the ratio of pigments in the leaves changed in response.
We got no significant results, but it was a fun combination of biology, chemistry, statistics and experimental design.
-->

I graduated second in my class of about 350 having received and accepted a Chancellor's Scholarship at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln.

## Undergraduate studies at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln
I choose the University of Nebraska - Lincoln (UNL) for their highly accredited actuarial science program. 
I did one year of business school, got a 97% in accounting, but thought that it was dreadfully boring. 
That, combined with anxiety about taking the actuarial exams motivated me to consider jobs outside of finance.

I attended a presentation by a group of actuaries who made actuarial software instead and thought that that would be a sensible pivot for me.
I took an intro to C programming class and was quickly hooked on computing. 
I switched to the School of Computing track with a second major in mathematics.

I was a teaching assistant for the same intro to C programming class and later a systems engineering class TA for [Dr. Bohn](https://computing.unl.edu/person/chris-bohn/). 
I was also a math resource center counselor and private tutor for a data structures and algorithms class. 
I greatly enjoyed all of those roles; it was fun working with the other students and sharing my passion for computers. 
I enjoyed low-level programming most, with the nitty-gritty of C being my favorite followed by C# for its simplicity in designing program architectures and Python as a good scratch-pad language for drafting ideas.

My second major at UNL was mathematics. The two favorite classes I took were elementary analysis and group theory. 
I really enjoyed my analysis class, but broadly I like discrete math better than analytical, perhaps because of the closer overlap with computer science.
I also took a great deal of statistics classes in combination of my actuarial studies.

Outside of classes, I enjoyed climbing at the gym, where I was in the university climbing club before the pandemic paused the club.
I also was and still am an avid board gamer. I was a regular attendee at the board game club's weekly meetings where I enjoyed overly complex strategy games.

## Senior design capstone with the USDA
My capstone project in the UNL school of computing was implementing an ArcGIS Online add-in for the United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resource Conservation Service (USDA NRCS). 
One of the functions of the Nebraska NRCS is protecting wetlands.
My five colleagues and I made an ArcGIS add-in for the USDA to assist in collating water, soil, and plant samples to generate wetland surveying, determination, and delineation documentation.

On the team I was the project's development manager and was tasked with assuring the team's product was technically sound.
I architected the program with an emphasis on code extensibility and maintainability. 
We had to change the database backing the tool and a future database change was anticipated, so the allowing future developers to easily adapt the application to organization needs was critical.
